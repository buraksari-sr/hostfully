# Add a new computer & Filtering computer name

There are two scenarios both in the "addNewCompueter" and "filteringComputerName" feature files

Both have positive and negative scenarios.

## Add a new computer

In the "Add a computer" page even though there are issues with 4 fields, it creates registration. For example; leaving field empty, writing same name, not choosing company etc.

According to the acceptance criteria or feature requirements module should be reviewed again.

## Filtering computer name

I was going to search for the newly created computer name in the previous scenario, but since it did not save it in the database, I searched for one of the existing computer name.
